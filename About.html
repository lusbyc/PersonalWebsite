<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p id="testID">

      This page is designed to tell you a little about me.

      I am a native Detroiter. I attended Renaissance High School. I moved to Atlanta where I graduated from Spelman College and lived for several years. Now that I'm back home I'm falling in love with the city all over again. I enjoy volunteering and have been involved with Habitat for Humanity since I was a college student in Atlanta. I've continued this volunteer work upon returning home where I now work with the local Detroit affiliate.
